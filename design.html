<div class="textblock"><p>This project collects a series of codes that I have written during the years for my own research. I found myself writing the same code over and over again, and tried several approaches to unify everything under a single master application that would do everything I ever needed.</p>
<p>This never really worked out as expected. One of the most advanced tool that was developed in our group with this principle in mind was the pi-DoMUS library (<a href="https://github.com/mathLab/pi-DoMUS">https://github.com/mathLab/pi-DoMUS</a>). After a couple of years of intense development, that project was abandoned as it became more and more difficult to maintain. That project relied eavily on a tool kit library, which we named deal2lkit (<a href="https://github.com/mathLab/deal2lkit">https://github.com/mathLab/deal2lkit</a>) <b>[SartoriGiulianiBardelloni-2018-a]</b></p>
<p>The deal2lkit library was a good starting point, but we quickly found out that the development of the deal.II library itself runs way faster than we could ever hope to keep up with, and we decided to slowly incorporate anything that could be savaged from deal2lkit into deal.II itself.</p>
<p>SymbolicFunction, <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/classFunctionParser.html">FunctionParser</a>, <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/classManifold.html">Manifold</a>, <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/classParameterAcceptor.html">ParameterAcceptor</a>, ParsedErrorTable, and the <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/classLinearOperator.html">LinearOperator</a> classes are some of the results of this effort, and are currently used widely by the deal.II community <b>[HeltaiBangerthKronbichler-2021]</b>, <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_MaierBardelloniHeltai-2016-a">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>The task is not finished yet. It is painful to port code from user space into a large library. The documentation requirements are stringent, proper testing is mandatory, and time always runs out.</p>
<p>When I started working on fluid structure interaction problems (2004), it was very difficult to find advanced codes that one could learn from. Deal.II itself only had 17 tutorial programs (<a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_17.html">step-17</a> was the most advanced one). Today there are exceptional examples that show how to do everything, often in different ways, and the number of example programs is growing at a speed which is very difficult to keep up with.</p>
<p>This project is what I wish I had at my disposal when I started working on FSI using deal.II. I collect here all the codes that I have written that relate in one way or another to fluid structure interaction problems.</p>
<p>Documentation is still largely missing. But I have tried to keep up with the main classes and functions. Since I have given up trying to build a "one-fits-all" code, this project goes in the opposite direction. I collected every common bit of code that I found mymeslf rewriting over and over again in the <a class="el" href="namespace_parsed_tools.html">ParsedTools</a> namespace, and rewrote some of the basic tutorial of deal.II that has to do with FSI using the <a class="el" href="namespace_parsed_tools.html">ParsedTools</a> namespace. This allows you to use the same base code for many different problems, and to keep the code as similar as possible, even when they solve very different problems. All repetitive tasks (like the creation of a mesh, the creation of a finite element space, the creation of a linear solver, writing output to files, etc.) are handled via objects that understand how to parse options from parameter files (i.e., they are derived from the <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/classParameterAcceptor.html">ParameterAcceptor</a> class)</p>
<p>Individual programs are as small as possible, and as clean as possible. Each code solves a single problem. A lot of duplication is unavoidable, but this has the advantage that it is easy to make incremental steps, and understand the most difficult parts of the FSI suite by walking through examples that increase in complexity, pretty much like it is done in the deal.II tutorial programs.</p>
<p>The structure of the FSI suite programs follows very closely deal.II tutorial programs. In each program, I try to point the reader to the steps that are required to understand what is going on.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="installation"></a>
Installation</h1>
<p>This project is hosted on GitHub. You can clone the repository using the command <code>git clone <a href="https://github.com/luca-heltai/fsi-suite.git">https://github.com/luca-heltai/fsi-suite.git</a></code>. This will generate a local copy of the repository in the directory <code>fsi-suite</code>. In order for you to run the code, you need to have the deal.II library installed and available in your default include path (i.e., <code>/usr/local/</code> or <code>/usr/</code>), or you should define the variable DEAL_II_DIR that points to your deal.II installation path.</p>
<p>The deal.II library should be installed with the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DEAL_II_WITH_MPI=ON</code></li>
<li><code>DEAL_II_WITH_PETSC=ON</code></li>
<li><code>DEAL_II_WITH_TRILINOS=ON</code></li>
<li><code>DEAL_II_WITH_MU_PARSER=ON</code></li>
<li><code>DEAL_II_WITH_SYMENGINE=ON</code></li>
<li><code>DEAL_II_WITH_UMFPACK=ON</code></li>
<li><code>DEAL_II_WITH_SUNDIALS=ON</code></li>
<li><code>DEAL_II_HAVE_CXX17=ON</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have downloaded the code, you can configure and compile it using the following:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">mkdir build</div>
<div class="line">cd build</div>
<div class="line">cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..</div>
<div class="line">make -j4</div>
<div class="line">./gtest</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The above will create a build directory, run cmake, compile the code, and run a test suite that checks that everything works fine. If everything succeeds, you should have a directory with a few executables in it (i.e., gtest, mesh_handler, dof_plotter, poisson, etc.).</p>
<p>I provide a docker image that can be used to build and run the code within a container. The image can be downloaded by <code>docker pull heltai/dealii:vscode</code>. This is also provided in the <code>.devcontainer</code> directory. If you open the folder using VisualStudio code, and have the Remote-Container extension installed, then you can build and run the code within a container that contains a full deal.II installation, simply by re-opening the folder in the container, and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>Notice that the container uses gcc, and this is quite memory intensive. If you don't have at least 16GB of RAM, you may encounter problems. In case compilation fails, you can try recompiling using fewer processors.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="general_structure"></a>
General structure of the FSI-suite</h1>
<p>The main source directories of the FSI-suite are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="dir_d44c64559bbebec7f509842c48db8b23.html">include</a>, containing the declaration for each of the classes and functions of the FSI-suite</li>
<li><a class="el" href="dir_b2f33c71d4aa5e7af42a1ca61ff5af1b.html">source</a>, containing the implementations and instantiations of most objects</li>
<li>tests, containing all the tests that are run on the FSI-suite with continuous integration based on github (see <a href="https://github.com/luca-heltai/fsi-suite/actions">https://github.com/luca-heltai/fsi-suite/actions</a>)</li>
<li><a class="el" href="dir_9654b8d08f4bba4e84b362c5fd320bee.html">apps</a>, containing the main files, used to generate the actual applications. If you want to create your own application, you can just copy it here in this folder, and cmake will compile it to an application with the same name of the source file (without extension).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other directories are accessible on the main repository page, and contain links to the video lectures, slides of each lecture, lecture notes, grids, and the input parameters used in the examples.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="start_here"></a>
Where to start?</h1>
<p>The applications <a class="el" href="mesh__handler_8cc.html" title="Mesh generator and reader.">mesh_handler.cc</a> and <a class="el" href="dof__plotter_8cc.html" title="Degrees of freedom plotter.">dof_plotter.cc</a> are the equivalent of <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_1.html">step-1</a> and <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_2.html">step-2</a> of the deal.II library. They show how to create a mesh and how to plot degrees of freedom on a grid. They allow you to get familiar with the building blocks defined in the <a class="el" href="namespace_parsed_tools.html">ParsedTools</a> namespace. <a class="el" href="mesh__handler_8cc.html" title="Mesh generator and reader.">mesh_handler.cc</a> shows how to use the <a class="el" href="class_parsed_tools_1_1_grid_generator.html" title="GridGenerator class.">ParsedTools::GridGenerator</a> class to create a mesh, or read it from a file, and how to write it out again, in a different format (this is useful, for example, if you want to visualise the mesh using, for example, Paraview, or <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/namespaceGmsh.html">Gmsh</a>).</p>
<p><a class="el" href="dof__plotter_8cc.html" title="Degrees of freedom plotter.">dof_plotter.cc</a> shows how to use the <a class="el" href="class_parsed_tools_1_1_finite_element.html" title="Parsed FiniteElement.">ParsedTools::FiniteElement</a> class, and how to use it in conjunction with the <a class="el" href="class_parsed_tools_1_1_data_out.html">ParsedTools::DataOut</a> class to generate <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/classFiniteElement.html">FiniteElement</a> objects from a parameter file, and to output simple functions to a graphical output file supported by deal.II (i.e., the de-facto standard output format <code>.vtu</code> or <code>.vtk</code>).</p>
<p>The entry point for partial differential equations treated in the FSI-suite is the <a class="el" href="class_p_d_es_1_1_serial_1_1_poisson.html" title="Poisson problem, serial version.">PDEs::Serial::Poisson</a> problem. This problem gathers together <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_3.html">step-3</a>, <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_4.html">step-4</a>, <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_5.html">step-5</a>, and <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_6.html">step-6</a> of the deal.II Library, and allows you to solve a <a class="el" href="class_p_d_es_1_1_serial_1_1_poisson.html" title="Poisson problem, serial version.">PDEs::Serial::Poisson</a> equation in an arbitrary domain (chosen via parameter files), using all available <a class="elRef" href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/classFiniteElement.html">FiniteElement</a> classes of the deal.II library, including Simplex elements. The FSI-suite is, at the moment, only supporting pure grids: either all-hex or all-tets meshes are supported.</p>
<p>If you want to navigate through the available partial differential equations that are solved by the FSI-suite, you should take a look at the <a class="el" href="namespace_p_d_es.html" title="We collect in this namespace all PDEs that are relevant to Fluid Structure Interaction Problems.">PDEs</a> namespace, where you will find a list of the available <a class="el" href="namespace_p_d_es.html" title="We collect in this namespace all PDEs that are relevant to Fluid Structure Interaction Problems.">PDEs</a>, with their connections. </p>
